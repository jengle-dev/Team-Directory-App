# Team-Directory-App

## Description
The project is to create a CLI (comand-line input) application that will ask questions and display the results in a dynamically created HTML file that has working links to each team member's specific link/profile. The page also needs to have tests available to verify that input meets the criteria.

## Packages
The user wants a webpage/app that consolidates and quickly displays their work team's basic info (e.g. names, emails, GitHub profiles).
When the email address is displayed, it will be a hyperlink that prompts the user's default email program to open and the TO field will show the email clicked.
