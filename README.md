# Team-Directory-App

## Description
The project is to create a CLI (comand-line input) application that will ask questions and display the results in a dynamically created HTML file that has working links to each team member's specific link/profile. 

## Usage
The user wanted an webpage/app that consolidates and quickly displays their team's basic info (e.g. names, emails, GitHub profiles).
