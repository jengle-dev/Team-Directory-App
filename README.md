# Team-Directory-App

## Description
The project is to create a CLI (comand-line input) application that will ask questions and display the results in a dynamically created HTML file that has working links to each team member's specific link/profile. The page also needs to have tests available to verify that input meets the criteria.

## Usage
The user wanted an webpage/app that consolidates and quickly displays their team's basic info (e.g. names, emails, GitHub profiles).

**Inquirer** </br>
Used to capture and use Node.js to utilize command line interface input in the application.
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4

**Jest** </br>
Used for testing.
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest

## Installation
Though I have the CDNs placed within the HTML generated file, I have also installed materialize-css via npm.</br>
* npm install materialize-css@next

The next install, Modernizr, automatically detects the availability of next-generation web technologies in your user's browsers. </br> 
* npm install -g modernizr


* npm install express


* npm install --save-dev jest
